# Regression-Model-using-python-code
This Python code accepts dataset of Dependent variables and Independent variables.
It splits data into train set and test set .
By using Independent dataset it calculates Regression Equation of Y on X and predict values accordingly.
It also do visualising of both training and test dataset.
